- ðŸ‘‹ Greetings, Iâ€™m @AdrianPiniek
I'm Poznan University of Technology (PUT) Computer Science Master's student, who loves all the tech stuff in theory and pracitce.
Most of my repos are private, so there isn't much
I like python and data science in general.
Right now I am studying django and Cloud technologies mostly AWS.
My master's thesis is about Edge Computing its purpose and prospects in accordance to more broadly used data-centers.
